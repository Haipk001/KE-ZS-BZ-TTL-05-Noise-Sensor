# Arduino Noise Sensor with KE-ZS-BZ-TTL-05

![Arduino Noise Sensor](sensor.jpg)

This Arduino project allows you to measure noise levels using the KE-ZS-BZ-TTL-05 Noise Sensor. It communicates with the sensor through AltSoftSerial and calculates the noise level in decibels (dB).

## Hardware Requirements

To use this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino board
- KE-ZS-BZ-TTL-05 Noise Sensor
- Jumper wires

## Wiring

Connect the KE-ZS-BZ-TTL-05 Noise Sensor to your Arduino as follows:

- Sensor RX to Arduino pin 9
- Sensor TX to Arduino pin 8
- Sensor +5V to Arduino 5V
- Sensor GND to Arduino GND

## Usage

1. Upload the Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
2. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor.
3. You will see the noise level displayed in decibels (dB) in the Serial Monitor.

## Hex Command Format

The project sends the following hex command to the sensor to request noise level data:

```
0x01 0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x84 0x0A
```

## Data Receive Format

The sensor responds with data in the following format:

```
0x01 0x03 0x02 0x02 0xC9 0x79 0x72
```

Where `0x02 0xC9` is the reading value of noise, which corresponds to 71.3 dB.

## Response Time

The response time of the sensor depends on the mode:

- Fast Mode: 500ms
- Slow Mode: 1.5 seconds

You can set the delay in the Arduino sketch accordingly.
