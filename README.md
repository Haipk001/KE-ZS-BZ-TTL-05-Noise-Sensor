# Arduino Noise Sensor with KE-ZS-BZ-TTL-05

![Arduino Noise Sensor](sensor.jpg)

This Arduino project enables you to measure noise levels using the KE-ZS-BZ-TTL-05 Noise Sensor. It communicates with the sensor through AltSoftSerial and calculates the noise level in decibels (dB).

## Hardware Requirements

To use this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino board
- KE-ZS-BZ-TTL-05 Noise Sensor
- Jumper wires

## Wiring

Connect the KE-ZS-BZ-TTL-05 Noise Sensor to your Arduino as follows:

- Sensor RX to Arduino pin 9
- Sensor TX to Arduino pin 8
- Sensor +5V to Arduino 5V
- Sensor GND to Arduino GND

## Usage

1. Upload the Arduino sketch provided in this repository to your Arduino board.
2. Open the Arduino Serial Monitor.
3. The Serial Monitor will display the noise level in decibels (dB) in real-time.

## Hex Command Format

The project sends the following hex command to the sensor to request noise level data:

```hex
0x01 0x03 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x84 0x0A
This command initiates the sensor to provide noise level data.

## Data Receive Format

The data received from the sensor is in the following format:
```hex
0x01 0x03 0x02 0x02 [Data_High] [Data_Low] [Checksum]
Where [Data_High] and [Data_Low] represent the noise level reading in decibels (dB).

## Response Time

The sensor has two response time modes:
Fast Mode: 500ms
Slow Mode: 1.5 seconds
You can set the delay in your Arduino sketch based on the desired response time mode.
